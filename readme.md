⚠ Project Essentials v3 under development ⚠

You can see any changed in commit history, when first snapshot v3 will ready, changes from this branch will merge in master branch.

Now Project Essentials repository structure and project structure will change, all modules have a names related to minecraft update version and every module with minecraft version will have a two submodules contains implementation for different mod loaders, `forge` and `fabric` at now.

Also, will change module system and improved API of every module, I'll make more easily installing a modules, directly in a chat, but it will restart the game anyway.

I'll fix my errors in structure, I'll improve memory using for your server feeling better when you have a many mods, and much of operations will be asynchronously.

Also, will implement in-game update checking for much faster and easily updating process.

Little later, when v3 will release, I'll remove old 1.14.4\1.15.2 branches, and it will mark as deprecated.

Thanks to `@hujle` for supporting me and makes motivation for me.
